# BC Prediction
The current project aims to predict childrenâ€™s encoding (producing cues to exhibit engagement or request feedback) and decoding (detecting backchannel or backchannel-inviting cues) abilities by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. The spontaneous conversational data involving children and adults come from the ChiCo Corpus. 

The binary classifier based on feature ranking is inspired by Van Bemmel et al., 2021(https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-87802-3_66)
